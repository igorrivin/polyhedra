# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to the Ideal Polyhedron Volume Toolkit are
recorded here. The project follows semantic versioning from the 0.4 release
onward.

## [Unreleased]

The current worktree is being prepared for version 0.4.0. It has not been
tagged or published. See [the 0.4 release and migration
note](docs/release-0.4.0.md) for compatibility details and the release gates.

### Added

- Explicit mpf-returning H³ Lobachevsky, Bloch–Wigner and local-tetrahedron
  helpers with scoped working precision and documented input conversions.
- Numerical precision, Rivin angle and optimizer-result contracts, including
  independent-reference regressions and preserved historical schema fixtures.
- A canonical H^3 optimization service in
  `ideal_poly_volume_toolkit.optimization`, shared by the command-line and GUI
  adapters.
- An installed `ideal-poly-optimize` command, owned by
  `ideal_poly_volume_toolkit.optimization_cli`; the former `bin/` script is a
  compatibility shim.
- A package-level `__version__` sourced from installed distribution metadata.
- Pole-aware sphere projection and a sphere-coordinate H^3 volume entry point.
- Explicit RL optimizer-work accounting for objective, surrogate, and gradient
  evaluations, with strict total-work budgets.
- Transactional incremental graph-Laplacian log-determinant support.
- Regression coverage for geometry invariance, gradients, optimization result
  accounting, RL budgets, cage optimizers, and incremental log determinants.
- A reproducible H^3 objective-throughput benchmark at
  `scripts/benchmark_h3_optimization.py`.
- A dedicated `geometry_torch` owner for optional differentiable H^3 kernels,
  with compatibility forwarding from `geometry`.
- Feature-specific `torch`, `plot`, `gui`, `graph`, `render`, and `rl`
  installation extras.
- Standard package license/project links and a source-distribution manifest
  that omits repository-only tests whose data and operational fixtures are not
  shipped in the sdist.
- Exact integer zero-shear PSL(2,Z) holonomy certificates, strict closed-sphere
  and finite-disk validators, and bounded worst-edge Rivin legalization.
- A versioned arithmetic-corpus schema and atomic, resumable producer with
  explicit infinity topology, canonical graph deduplication, deterministic
  layered-ring constructions, and bounded numerical witness campaigns.

### Changed

- Current optimizer producers emit schema v2 with fresh endpoint validation,
  separate verification-evaluation counts and strict JSON. Historical v1
  schemas and artifacts remain unchanged; consumers select the schema by
  version. Solver convergence remains separate from candidate validity.
- Strict angle feasibility now maximizes a common positive angle/inequality
  margin in units of pi. Legacy result names remain, with measured margins
  and the numerical evidence status made explicit.
- Rivin interior-only classification uses the final converged dihedral ties;
  temporary active constraints may be released. The bounded seed-2 regression
  now takes two legalization flips instead of one; no speed gain is claimed.
- H^3 objective evaluation now uses a vectorized double-precision
  Bloch--Wigner path instead of the former per-triangle Torch series loop.
- CLI and GUI optimization results use the same versioned schema. The full
  spherical boundary includes the explicit index of the implicit infinity
  vertex, while the legacy `triangulation` field remains an alias for the
  finite Delaunay triangulation.
- Optimization trial volumes are consistently positive. Invalid penalty-only
  trials serialize with `volume: null` and are excluded from statistics.
- The CLI `--popsize` option is documented and applied as SciPy's population
  multiplier, and the optimizer exposes an explicit worker count.
- Canonical RL imports now live under `ideal_poly_volume_toolkit.rl`; the
  former package-root modules remain compatibility shims for the 0.4 cycle.
- Gradio is constrained to its tested 6.x API.
- The base install now contains only the NumPy/SciPy/mpmath numerical stack;
  core H^3 geometry and optimization no longer import or install Torch.
- The supported Python range is 3.10 through 3.14. A normal
  dependency-resolved CPython 3.14.7 ARM64 environment passes the package,
  test, import, CLI, GUI, app, and CPU-autograd checks; x86-64 confirmation is
  delegated to CI, and free-threaded 3.14t is not currently claimed.
- Distribution sampling now uses process-count-independent seeded logical
  batches, bounded retries, at most 16 automatic workers, and explicit
  rejection, numerical-failure, completion, and effective-worker metadata.
  Bootstrap resampling uses the CLI seed without modifying NumPy's global RNG.
- Developer-only Torch gradient and optimizer diagnostics now have the
  explicit `scripts/_debug/` owner; the former flat paths remain executable
  compatibility launchers.
- Arithmetic corpus `--n-vertices` now means total ideal vertices, including
  the explicit infinity vertex. Exact abstract holonomy and floating
  coordinate/KKT/realization residuals are recorded as separate claims.

### Fixed

- Binary64 Bloch–Wigner evaluation reduces extreme finite arguments without
  overflowing squared magnitudes. Multiprecision conversion avoids initial
  float underflow, restores precision on failure, and stabilizes tiny
  imaginary components near the negative real axis.
- Angle optimization preserves constraints without angle clipping, releases
  incorrectly active inequalities and requires full original-constraint/KKT
  residuals. Failed or malformed LP endpoints remain explicit failures.
- Angle feasibility reports now distinguish verified numerical witnesses from
  unsuccessful or subthreshold runs; volume-call counts include line-search
  starting values, rejected trials and final reporting values.
- Final angle volumes use the canonical Bloch–Wigner kernel instead of a
  64-term Fourier report. The value helper also replaces cutoff quadrature
  with the canonical Clausen identity and explicit endpoint/domain handling.
- Optimization ranks freshly verified endpoints, retains an earlier valid
  candidate after later rejection, and isolates callback edits from internal
  trial history and winning geometry.
- Volume-threshold inputs reject NaN coordinates/thresholds and boolean
  series lengths; threshold decisions are documented as numerical.
- Exact zero-shear certification now tests the original declared real values,
  so a nonzero rational that underflows in floating-point diagnostics is not
  promoted to an exact certificate.
- Rigid triangle development now preserves cyclic face orientation, anchors
  an actual edge under relabeling, and requires angle/orientation/closure
  residuals before reporting numerical success.
- The public Lobachevsky derivative helpers use their actual formulas near
  both endpoints; values outside the open interval (0, pi) raise `ValueError`
  instead of returning misleading finite sentinels.

- Corrected Bloch--Wigner and Lobachevsky autodiff behavior.
- Corrected pole projection, positive rescaling invariance, coplanar hull-face
  reconstruction, and near-degenerate volume gradients.
- Corrected optimizer sign handling, population accounting, invalid-trial
  selection, and spherical-boundary topology reporting.
- Corrected RL best-solution bookkeeping, strict budget enforcement, stale
  triangulation caches, failure accounting, and several ineffective legacy
  moves.
- Corrected graph-swap/log-determinant transactions and disconnected-graph
  handling.
- Corrected distribution analysis so serial output is always an ndarray,
  unexpected evaluation errors propagate, tetrahedra are the minimum valid
  configuration, and small or invalid bootstrap counts are handled safely.
- Corrected distribution goodness-of-fit calls for SciPy 1.17/1.18 by binding
  fitted CDF parameters explicitly and selecting the new Anderson p-value
  method without breaking older supported SciPy versions.
- Corrected Penner-Rivin holonomy words to use one root frame and the proper
  orientation-independent crossing involution; missing shears can no longer
  default to zero, and small cross-ratios are no longer clamped to zero.
- Corrected arithmeticity semantics: near-integral traces of a selected
  generator basis are diagnostic only, open Delaunay disks cannot vacuously
  certify, and exact arithmetic claims require the zero-shear PSL(2,Z) path.

### Performance

- Vectorized Bloch--Wigner and triangle accumulation substantially reduce H^3
  objective-evaluation time. Reproducible claims must cite the benchmark
  harness, raw samples, source hashes, and execution environment rather than a
  single ad hoc timing.
- H^3 optimization with worker processes now keeps differential evolution
  parallel but runs L-BFGS-B polishing serially, avoiding fine-grained process
  dispatch overhead while preserving SciPy's acceptance and evaluation-count
  semantics.

### Deprecated

- Package-root RL import modules are compatibility shims; new code should
  import from `ideal_poly_volume_toolkit.rl`.
- Distribution analysis accepts `--series-terms` for compatibility, but the
  vectorized Bloch--Wigner path ignores it.
- Flat `scripts/debug_*.py` and
  `scripts/test_{from_bad_init,gradients,lbfgs_issue}.py` diagnostic paths are
  compatibility launchers through 0.4.x. Use `scripts/_debug/`; the launchers
  may be removed in 0.5.0.

### Known limitations

- Historical RL validation results predate strict work accounting and are not
  current efficiency evidence. Controllers must be retrained and revalidated.
- The H^4 Delaunay decomposition remains unreliable for certain highly
  symmetric non-generic point sets, including the 10--10 duoprism.
- Non-simplicial facet merging and the two-level facet optimizer still have
  documented correctness limitations.
- Incremental `fast_logdet` is validated independently but is not yet wired
  into the cage optimizers.
- Historical 20-, 50-, and 100-vertex arithmetic benchmark artifacts fail the
  current coordinate-shear/full-boundary certificate and are retained only as
  superseded provenance, not ground truth.
